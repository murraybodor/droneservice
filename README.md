Drone Service Coding Exercise - Nov 7 2016
==========================================


*Prepared for Agile Recruiting / SigFig Wealth Management*

**Please note the following important assumption made within the code**

We're always going to use the biggest drone provided for every trip. Here's why: 
- it costs the same to refuel as the smaller ones
- using any of the smaller drones will require more total trips
- there are no requirements to use all of the drones provided, or to minimize the number of trips taken per drone, or to save time
